# C3S

C3S is a website builder that simplifies the creation and maintenance of content managed websites. It was designed with the following goals in mind:

* Provide a way to host a complex CMS driven website on a simple web server without any special server requirements (no Java, no PHP).
* Provide a way to decouple the structure of a website and its contents where:
  * the site structure is defined by page templates and configuration files, without implementing any Java or Javascript.
  * content is managed outside the platform through well established headless content providers.
* Make a generic content query language that abstracts and simplifies access to content inside the (verbose) underlying content provider.

## Who should use C3S?

* Back-end developers who grasp every opportunity to avoid writing a single line of Javascript.
* Developers who want to use a CMS but don't want to host a Drupal, Wordpress or (god forbid) a Java based CMS.
* Developers who want to be able to switch to another CMS without having to rewrite their website.
* Developers who want to be in full control of the site structure & theming, but at the same time delegate any content management to webmasters.
